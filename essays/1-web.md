# How The Web Works?

The web is a text-based world-wide network that is used to share information using text, images, and other media.
A website is a collection of webpages, a webpage is a text page that contains some information,
which can link to other webpages using hyperlinks.
A webpage can be created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
A website can be hosted on a computer to a network (which we call a server).
We can access a website using its IP address or its domain name through DNS.
When we type the website address on a browser (or with other tool), we make a HTTP(S) request to its server,
the server should handle this request and return a webpage as a response.
HTTP is a protocol which is built on top of the TCP protocol, and it's usually how a server and a client communicate,
though other protocols may be used depending on the functionality.
