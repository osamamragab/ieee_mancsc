# The Client-Server Approach
The client-server approach is used to separate the clients (frontend) from servers (backend),
which is great for scalability and resource management.
For example if you need more computational power you can simply add more servers.

### Client
A client can be a device, application, or a website,
it's responsible for user interface and handling user interactions.
It sends the server a request for a service or data, the interprets the response and show to the user.

### Server
The server(s) is responsible for the services and managing data,
it can process client requests and do the requested operations, and may return a response.
Most servers are built to handle multiple requests for multiple clients

### Communication
Clients and servers communicate through a specific protocol to achieve the desired functionality.
For example they can use the HTTP protocol and the JSON format for requests and responses.
